# ElectricFieldProject
Electric Field Project - Project conceived and developed by Francesco De Nicola and Lorenzo Arcangeli

This program developed in javafx simulates the motion of electric charges attracted or repelled by other charges with greater force

### Electric Field
The circle in the background represents the range of the central charge, the only charge that interacts with all other charges

### Insert new charges
By clicking in the upper right on one of the charges (Red indicates positive, Blue indicates negative) you can place new charges on the test field.

When you insert a new charge you can hold the mouse and drag in any direction to impart a force to it

When you release the mouse this force is applied to the charge, which will begin to follow its natural motion

### Clear button
By clicking on the button at the top right of the screen you can clean the entire field by removing all the test charges, also if a charge leaves the screen it is automatically deleted

### Impact of charges
When charges impact the main sphere the latter will increase or decrease its radius and charge (up to a certain limit set by us)

To change the properties of the central charge, just click on it and a special menu will appear
